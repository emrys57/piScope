As proposed by chatGPT4Turbo

TO START THIS PROGRAM:
You do not need to build or anything fancy.
Open firefox and go to
file:///home/emryswilliams/Documents/GitHub/piScope/index.html
and everything will magically pop into life.

package.json must not specify type: module
but start file at index.mjs must be mjs.

Do
npm run build
after editing the source to creat a new dist/bundle.js
